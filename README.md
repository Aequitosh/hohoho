# HoHoHo!

This repository contains an interpreter for **HOHOHO!** - an adapted version of
Santa's programming language: **HoHoHo!**

I heard some of the other elves say that one particular elf might try to
reconstruct the original language here as well. But who knows, all of us are
busy all the time!

## Specification

Both of these languages are equivalent to [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
**HOHOHO!** however is not just *louder* when you read it (try it!), it's
actually made from hydrogen, oxygen and holmium, Santa's favourite elements.

| Brainfuck | HoHoHo! | HOHOHO! |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| +         | HoHoHo  | HOHOHO  |
| -         | hohoho  | HoHoHo  |
| >         | HoHoho  | HOHOHo  |
| <         | hoHoHo  | HoHOHO  |
| [         | Hohoho  | HOHoHo  |
| ]         | hohoHo  | HoHoHO  |
| .         | hoHoho  | HoHOHo  |
| ,         | HohoHo  | HOHoHO  |

## Why are there two HoHoHo!s?

While the original HoHoHo! specification is [documented rather well](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06259.pdf),
some say the other one was made because Santa decided to visit some chemists.
Nobody is really sure, though.

Maybe more will be uncovered soon?
